# Instructioons: Update the version according to semver. If the version is
# different from the previous versions, this will automatically create a
# "stable" release on PyPI. Otherwise, all merges to the main branch will create
# a "pre-release" on PyPI. In that case, the version will be suffixed with
# ".dev" and date and the git commit hash
